HTTP requests filter module for ulogd2

This module sniffs HTTP requests including the HOST, URI and the METHOD (POST, GET).

If ONLY_LOG_HTTPSNIFF is defined (the default), packets not having "HOST: ..." and/or URI informations ("GET ..." or "POST ...") are discarded

The code is based on the filter_PWSNIFF code and only has been tested on ulogd2 2.0.5 outputting to a MySQL database.


A SQL dump for MySQL is provided, including the INSERT_HTTPSNIFF procedure that does the matching if the "HOST:" and the "GET/POST" are separated in two different packets ; the event "cleanUlogd" that does a daily cleanup of entries older then 2 months.

There are also an host and an uid whitelist tables, if the HOST or the uid of a request is listed on the corresponding table, the request wont be logged on the table.

===> COMPILATION

To be able to build the module, you need to put ulogd_filter_HTTPSNIFF.c on the filter/ directory of the ulogd2 sourcecode then patch filter/Makefile.am:
 $ patch -p0 -i /path/to/patch_Makefile.diff

There are currently (11 Jan 2018) two bugs on the code of ulogd2 that are problematic with this module.
For more informations about those : https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1192 and https://bugzilla.netfilter.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1193

Patchs for those two bugs is provided for both 2.0.5 and the trunk tree (use at your own risk) :
 $ patch -p0 -i /path/to/patch_fix_rawstr.VERSION.diff
 $ patch -p0 -i /path/to/patch_fix_strings_malloc.VERSION.diff

Then you must compile ulogd2 as usual.

===> CONFIGURATION

Add this line to load the plugin :

 plugin="/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ulogd/ulogd_filter_HTTPSNIFF.so"

Example of use to log to a MySQL database :
 stack=log1:NFLOG,base1:BASE,ifi1:IFINDEX,ip2bin1:IP2BIN,mac2str1:HWHDR,httpsniff1:HTTPSNIFF,mysql1:MYSQL

Create the database by importing the example SQL database, please not that it includes "examples" on the whitelist tables that you might not want.

Then set the "procedure" parameter of you SQL connection such as :
 procedure="INSERT_HTTPSNIFF"

Example of use with a iptables/NFLOG rule to log outgoing connections :
 iptables -I OUTPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 80 -m limit --limit 5/s -j NFLOG --nflog-range 512
